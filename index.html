    <h3>Building an open API for archaeological data</h3>

  This talk is on github so follow along at<br />

<div>
  I'm an ex-archaeologist and GeoGeek,
  <em>Passionate</em> about open source software, open data and open standards,
  (and still <em>very</em> keen on archaeology)
</div>
<div>Beyond the Castle and HackLancaster: our story begins</div>
<div>

</div>
<div>The Brief: Open up the data in the Lancaster UAD for use in a 24hr hackathon</div>
<div>...in a prison<br />
  <img src='images/hack_lanc_logo.jpg' />
</div>
<div>Question: How to achieve this with not a lot of time (or money)?</div>
<div><img src='images/golden-retriever-and-science1.jpg' /></div>
<div>UADs are great resources, but often locked away and never really used. The best-case scenario is absorption into the SMR/HER.</div>
<div><img src='images/archives.jpg' />
...useful?
</div>
<div>My scientific check on this:<br />
  <img src='images/twitter_question.png' /></div>
<div>
  The Result:
</div>
<div>... (nothing)
</div>
<div>Beyond the hackathon, whatever we did had to be <em>standards-compliant, updateable, reusable and sustainable</em> in the long term</div>
<div>The data I had to work with:<br />
  A number of spatial datasets (shape files),<br />
  An access 97 database,<br /> 
  Lots of georeferenced scans of historic maps,<br />
  Lots of historic images such as paintings or photos
</div>
<div>Task #1: Get the data out of Microsoft Access 97!</div>
<div>PostgreSQL was a no-brainer due to it's spatial capabilities, and there are plenty of open source, OS-agnostic libraries for working with MS Access.<br />
I used the following and combined them into some python scripts for future reuse:<br />
  <ul>
    <li>PyODBC</li>
    <li>csv</li>
    <li>mdbtools</li>
  </ul>
  (see <a  target='_blank' href='https://github.com/archaeogeek/mdb2postgres'>github.com/archaeogeek/mdb2postgres</a>)
</div>
<div>Task #2: Make the spatial data available via a web interface</div>
<div>Again, looking for open source, sustainable, re-usable options, I choose Geoserver for the web-based gui
  <br />
  <img src='images/GeoServer_500.png' />
</div>
<div data-bodyclass='center-image'>This also allowed me to create seamless base mapping layers from the <a target='_blank' href='http://lancasteruadgeo.oxfordarchaeology.com/geoserver/web/?wicket:bookmarkablePage=:org.geoserver.web.demo.MapPreviewPage'>historic maps</a><br /></div>
<div>
  <img src='images/mackreth1778.png' />
</div>
<div>Task #3: Make the non-spatial data available</div>
<div>RESTful approaches seemed best, so I found <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/alixaxel/ArrestDB">ArrestDB</a><br />
  This allowed us to use a simple tablename/attribute protocol to get at data in a json format, eg <a target='_blank' href='http://lancasteruad.oxfordarchaeology.com/rest/index.php/tblBibliography/?limit=5&by=Doc_Title'>first 5 entries in the bibliography table, ordered by title</a></div>
<div>Task #4: Allow some spatial analysis</div>
<div>REST again! <a target='_blank' href="http://maps.co.mecklenburg.nc.us/rest/">Dirt-Simple POSTGIS HTTP API</a><br />
  This provided an interface for accessing PostGIS functions such as buffers, intersects, and reprojections, again returning results in json format<br />
  For example <a target="_blank" href="http://lancasteruad.oxfordarchaeology.com/pgrest/v1/ws_geo_getcentroid.php?table=monspres_polys&srid=4326&geometryfield=wkb_geometry&parameters=monid=%27531%27">the centroids of a specific monument</a>
</div>
<div>Along with the images, all of this was hosted on a linux virtual machine running a simple web server</div>
<div>Documentation was produced using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gitbook.io/">GitBook</a><br />
  So it was available <a target="_blank" href="http://hacklancaster.github.io/beyondthecastle_uad/index.html">online</a> and could be updated throughout the hackathon as needed</div>
<div>So, how did it go?</div>
<div>Two teams of hackers used the data</div>
<div>
  <img src='images/hack_team_1.jpg' />
</div>
<div>The first created a mobile app, allowing people to follow trails<br />
  around the City "checking in" to monuments<br /></div>
<div>
  <img src='images/hack_team_2.jpg' />
</div>
<div>The second created a tool visualising the distribution of finds by period and type</div>
<div>
  <img src='images/hack_team_3.jpg' />
</div>
<div>Observations (NOT criticisms)</div>
<div><em># 1: UAD data is complicated!</em><br />
  The heavily relational structure is hard to navigate<br />
  The controlled language is opaque and can be difficult to understand.<br />
  See the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fish-forum.info/i_apl_e.htm">RCHME Archaeological Periods List</a> for an example<br />
  <em>Simple</em> questions become <em>complex</em> queries</div>
<div><em># 2: GIS knowledge is specialised</em><br />
  The historic base maps and PostGIS functions were not used<br />
  We can't assume everyone has geospatial or analytical expertise
</div>
<div><em># 3: People may jump to tenuous conclusions</em><br />
  Correlation does not equal causation!<br />
  &ldquo;(non-professional) interpretations may... be regarded by the archaeologist as an exercise in myth or superstition&rdquo;
  <footer>Suzie Thomas, the University of Helsinki</footer>
</div>
<div>In conclusion, non-archaeologists may use the data in unexpected ways...<br />
BUT using genuine archaeological data is a step forward in public engagement with the discipline.</div>
<div>Moving forward...</div>
<div>We have a framework that could be quickly and easily applied to any UAD to make it available online and for wider use/analysis by both archaeologists and the general public</div>
<div>All the components are open source, and don't require a huge amount of expertise to assemble or configure</div>
<div>Processes can be automated and repeated, so the data can be updated whenever necessary</div>
<div>BUT...</div>
<div>We need a "translation-layer" to convert UAD terminologies and structures into something easier for non-specialists to understand, without losing the academic rigour</div>
<div>Deeply relational structures could be flattened into single tables<br />
  but this may bring additional complications<br />
  for updating, querying, displaying etc...</div>
<div>However the flexibility of this approach means that multiple front-ends can be constructed to serve different purposes and engage with different demographics</div>
 <div>So you want to produce a Tinder for Monuments? Go ahead!</div>
 <div>
 <img src='images/tinder.jpg' />
</div>
<div>You can also take advantage of the latest technology</div>
<div>
  <img src='images/3D_GIS.jpg' />
</div>
<div>The risk of <em>not</em> engaging is that real harm is done through lack of knowledge</div>
<div>
  <img src='images/tomb_bench.png' />
</div>
<div>The most important thing is to make your data available because...</div>
<div><blockquote>&ldquo;The coolest thing to do with your data will be thought of by someone else&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<div>and...<br />
